<p>What information can numbers communicate?</p>

<p>
	COUNTLESS is a project in the realm of information design, typography,
	interaction and web design, that investigates what stories numbers carry and
	communicate. What is hidden behind a sole numeral? What meanings and
	significances it carries? Do you have numbers that are part of your story
	and that help situate your positionality?
</p>

<p>
	It is a project to explore personal or collective connotations and
	connections represented in numerals. What they tell, and what lies hidden.
	It plays with information design and the readiness of content that is
	displayed in infographics and distorts the ways we interact with that
	content. In infographics, numbers are part of a message that associates
	forms, shapes and text to convey its meaning. In this project, they are
	presented first naked of any complementary subject.
</p>

<p>
	Data, often numerical, is the core of information design. By revealing only
	the numerical layer, with no direct explanation connected, a wide range of
	significance can be attributed to numbers. From another perspective, sole
	numbers are also a way to strip all the meaning and direct attention to the
	medium, as Jasper Johns does in his work 0 to 9, for example. Attempting to
	reach the essence is not a strange concept in art history—we could argue
	that such a description encompasses much of the modernist movement. This is
	an experiment that exaggerates modernist intentions to reflect upon
	communication, empathy and effectiveness of numbers.

<p>
	The project is an online web-based platform that uses a sole numeral as the
	main interface, with the story connected to it hidden on a separate, hidden
	layer. The objective is to instigate the curiosity and interest of the
	audience for the impact of the graphic sign of the number itself, by
	stripping the message of all content, except the numerical one. It is
	thought of as a participative, co-design platform that invites the audience
	to input numbers that are resonant to their lives, and to share their
	meanings. Those numbers and messages entered will be fed into the database
	and will be shown to the audience on the interface being designed.

<p>
	The user interface should allow for the stories behind the numerals to be
	revealed upon navigation on this website, but they will remain covered for
	the main part—uncovering it will require active, engaged participation of
	the audience.

</a>

<p>
	Being an open project, it is meant to be a scaffold for data to be input by
	the audience, who will choose by themselves if the numerals shared have a
	personal, regional or universal importance. This mix of information at
	various levels, public and private, hopes to achieve an empathic connection
	with the public that is invited to see and engage with the work.
