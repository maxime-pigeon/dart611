<p>
	As an architect and designer, I often re-imagine spaces after an initial
	critique and appreciation. I then try to establish each elementâ€™s
	functionality, differentiating value and participation. My perception of
	space and surrounding environments changed drastically after the pandemic
	came into existence. In the past year, the world came to a standstill after
	the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. During this time, interactions have
	been minimal making people crave company and conversation. This project is
	an attempt to change the ways we dine during a pandemic while reframing our
	meaning of social connectedness.
</p>

<p>
	A spatial strategy in a restaurant is proposed to encourage safety and
	socialisation during a pandemic, by exploring biological ontologies,
	affordances of objects and actor-network theories. The overarching question
	I am trying to answer is how social distancing and social connectedness may
	co-exist in a communal dining space.

	Thinking through different configurations of communal spaces and the
	logistics of conveyor belts resulted in a 1:15 scaled model of 2500sq.ft
	that could cater to 50 occupants at a given time. The chef station performs
	as a central nucleus and converging point for all the conveyor belts. The
	prototype explores an operating system of three demarcated zones/nodes (A
	purple zone for individuals, a blue zone for groups of 2 and a yellow zone
	for families and larger groups) for easy identification and crowd
	management.
</p>

<p>
	The operating system identifies human-to-human, human-to-belt and
	human-to-chef interactions and allows interlaced conversations between a
	family dining around one convoluted belt and a family dining at another.

	The proposed dining arrangement is a result of abductive reasoning from
	gathered observations of various layouts, shapes, forms and materials. I
	have also tried to adopt a multidisciplinary approach that combines colour
	theories and gamification aspects of interaction design as well as
	architectural design strategies of zoning, scale and form.
