<p>
	The German philosopher Theodor W. Adorno defines the essay genre as an
	unmethodical method. The essay, he writes, takes the arena of intellectual
	experience as its model, interweaving the battling
	arguments-slash-gladiators as in a carpet—it proceeds, so to speak,
	methodically unmethodically.
</p>
<p>
	Of course, being the good German philosopher that he is, Adorno never
	manages to explain exactly what he means by this. On the contrary, one can
	almost imagine him dropping the proverbial mic with a machiavellian grin,
	quite content to end his paragraph with the now famous oxymoronic formula, a
	formula that means both everything and nothing, and on which desperate
	graduate students will write countless theses, guaranteeing his eternal
	popularity.
</p>
<p>
	This project is an attempt to weave (or unweave?) my own carpet, with the
	aim of understanding and enacting (or understanding by enacting) the essay’s
	unmethodical method. The resulting pilgrimage-in-the-form-of-a-book,
	comprising a collection of eclectic voices that reflect both directly and
	indirectly on Adorno’s formula, is dedicated to my dear partners in
	misfortune, my fellow readers of arcane philosophy, in hopes of allowing
	them, too, to understand whatever our German friend means.
