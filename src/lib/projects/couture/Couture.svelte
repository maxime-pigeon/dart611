	This project, TEMPORAL FIBER, looks into the subject matter of the typical
	architectural drawing and its functioning. It studies its ‘notational’ and
	‘referential’ characteristics, or, in other words, how it uses a codified
	language to create a ‘representational experience’ of a targeted object.
	Such drawings create a fictional representation in the mind of the observer,
	which cannot correspond to the lived experience of the existing artifact.
	TEMPORAL FIBER questions the composition of common architectural drawings
	and tries to reduce the gap between the represented object and the actual
	building by rendering the fourth dimension: the <i>time</i>.

	The main objective of this prototype is to incorporate traces of temporality
	into the static representation, in that case, of a Montreal apartment. It
	asks: how can we illustrate the passage of time through the architectural
	space and its physical component by using the paper-space? Many techniques
	are explored to conduct this experiment, mainly borrowing from the media of
	writing, mapping, comics and infographics. To accomplish that conceptual
	inquiry, this (re)model of the studied apartment presents itself as a
	semi-flat/semi-tridimensional maquette combining both the art of printing
	and origami to articulate a visual language defying traditional
	architectural drawings.

	The visual experiments, embodied by the cyan ink in the drawing, fall into
	three categories (and the intersection between them). In the scope of this
	project, I named these three approaches for telling narratives as such:
	<i>illustrative</i>, <i>annotative</i> and <i>mapping</i>.

	TEMPORAL FIBER uses the automatic tools of <i>ink-jet printing</i> and
	<i>digitally controlled cutting</i> to design an efficient workflow replicable
	at different scales. The tridimensional model allows the viewer to perceive spaces,
	openings, natural light and the articulation of the rooms, without requiring
	the use of perspective or axonometric drawings. Since the model can be dismantled
	and is made of papery fiber, it embodies the temporality and the ephemerality
	that this project attempts to study in the built environment.
