	The premise of this project starts as a critique of architectural drawings.
	It is framed around the idea that the current modes of representation from
	the field are unable to convey the temporality of buildings. For example,
	Bruno Latour and Albena Yaneva write about the need that we have for a
	device that would transform the static view of a building into a sequence of
	fix frames informing us about the continuous flow from which a building is
	always constituted. Since buildings are usually represented, after the fact
	by a regime of idealized images—mostly photographic or pseudo-realistic
	rendering—this criticism makes us think about ways to represent buildings in
	all their complexity and through all their life cycle.

	Yaneva continues this reflection by asserting that “buildings are never
	immobile, still, stationary and put in space. As soon as you interact with
	it a complete qualitative impression emanates. A building can be understood
	only in a cumulative series of repetitive interactions that introduce its
	most enriching and defining features. There is a continuous building up of
	the architectural object”. This quote brings forward another important
	aspect of my project, which is to highlight how important is the observation
	and the engagement with a particular building for one to construct a
	relevant critique or a thoughtful portrait of it. In this project, the act
	of drawing will be involved in two moments to enhance the faculty to
	articulate and understand the case being studied.
