	In the context of the current pandemic and Quebec’s new health regulations
	that make procedural masks with filters mandatory on all university
	campuses, I have decided to investigate skin-friendlier sustainable options
	for users with Maskne or difficulties breathing. As of February 15 2021,
	Concordia University started enforcing the use of procedure masks
	(blue-white surgical masks), deeming reusable or cloth face coverings are no
	longer acceptable. While procedure masks are readily available for those
	entering with facemasks that don’t comply, from a health and sustainability
	perspective this is worrying. Concordia University has stated “while waiting
	for details about government-led recycling of procedure masks, Concordia is
	working to provide a collection service in keeping with its institutional
	commitment to sustainability.”

	Since the start of the pandemic in 2020 alone, over 1.56 billion procedure
	masks were disposed in our oceans, which adds up to 6240 tons of extra
	plastic. This additional source of textile waste is of increased concern as
	the procedure masks are primarily composed of plastics with the most common
	material being polypropylene. These masks could take up to 450 years to
	decompose while releasing environmentally harmful microplastics. Moreover,
	the straps of the masks may pose a threat of entangling animals. Some
	activists have called for mask wearer to cut the straps before
	disposing(insert citation CTV news). This project aims to explore
	sustainable alternatives to address these environmental issues as well as
	consider health issues of mask wearers.

	Skin allergies, acne and breathing issues faced by mask wearers have been of
	growing concern since the start of the pandemic. “Maskne” has been coined as
	the new acne. Acne Mechanica is a skin condition brought on by prolonged
	wear of facial personal protective equipment. The combination of heat,
	friction, blockage and humidity results in Maskne. Basically, masks
	accumulate oil, sweat and dirt, which is reapplied to the wearer’s face
	constantly. The people most affected by this issue are those who suffer from
	skin conditions such as rosacea, acne, eczema, allergies and other
	sensitivities to humid or dry air. As a result, the main variables that
	affect Maskne are existing skin issues, weather conditions (heat and
	humidity levels), breathability, friction, material and chemical fabric
	treatments. Commercial masks are made of synthetic fabric that can cause
	irritation, and are pre-treated with formaldehyde for disinfection purposes,
	which can cause allergies. Additionally, heavily scented detergents or
	softeners used for cleaning may lead to itching, redness or rashes. In
	response, this project will explore mask design alternatives that reduce
	skin irritation in an environmentally conscious way.
