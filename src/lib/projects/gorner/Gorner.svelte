	Palliative Care for the End of Times (PCftEoT) is a digital booklet
	comprised of prose reflecting on the phenomenological impacts of perceiving
	one is living at an “end time” alongside photographic documentation of a
	material process working with kombucha scobies and stick and poke tattoo.
	The intention of the text is to disorient the reader in regards to how we
	perceive and treat pain, grief, and care within our societal context; in the
	last sections of text, the reader is willed to imagine a future where
	Western colonial binaries of life/death, pain/pleasure, and work/rest have
	been deconstructed.

	The material process for the PCftEoT digital booklet seeks to explore
	concepts of singularity, intimacy, and permanence as they appear within the
	previously mentioned binaries, while also taking “a deliberate shift away
	from humancentredness, where matter and place have been positioned as
	objects in relation to human subjects, to recognise a vitality of matter as
	both subject and collaborator” (Smitherman and Joseph, 2020). In working
	with living things, the scobies as well as my own flesh, the process became
	a relational collaboration between myself and the materials and took on its
	own directions which diverged from the initial intentions for the final
	artefact guided by the central research question: What is the
	phenomenological impact of perceiving that one is living in an end time on
	individual experiences?

	PCftEoT asks its reader to reflect on the ways that habit, cycle, and
	ritual, affect both our own phenomenological state and our environment in
	regards to how we manage and attempt to control and compartmentalize pain,
	grief, and the cyclical nature of our existence.
