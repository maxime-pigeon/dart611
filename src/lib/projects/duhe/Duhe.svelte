	Creating a typeface on a computer screen can sometimes limit creativity. The
	digital work space, the white window of the software, the two-dimensional
	shaping, the grid proportions, and the basic tracing tools all constitute
	elements which influence the conception of a letter. Rare are the designers
	who leave these optimized digital tools, to bring some materiality and
	reality in their work process.

	A good example would be the approach of Karl Nawrot, a French designer who
	“thinks like an architect.” He develops experimental type systems and tools
	to produce innovative and enigmatic shapes. By leaving standards type design
	tools and environment, he sets his own constraints. For a moment, he forgets
	the letter, its origin and its heritage, and develops unexpected forms. This
	approach brings uniqueness to his work, and stands out from the type design
	landscape.

	According to the field of sculpture, the French type designer Morgane Van
	Torre included in a way, some materiality in her work process, by taking
	inspiration in sculptural shapes of Henry Moore, Hans Arp and Max Bill to
	realize a typeface. Despite this intention, the form wasn’t found by the
	physical manipulation of the material and this is not an approach I would
	like to consider for the project Reading Shapes, Writing Sculptures.
