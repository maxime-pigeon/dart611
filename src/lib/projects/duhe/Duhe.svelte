	Creating a typeface on a computer screen can sometimes limit creativity. The
	digital workspace, the white window of the software, the two-dimensional
	shaping, the grid proportions, and the basic tracing tools all constitute
	elements which influence the conception of a letter. Rare are the designers
	who leave these optimized digital tools, to bring some materiality and
	reality in their work process.
</p>
<p>
	Instead of considering type design a drawing of the inside and outside lines
	of a character, I was interested to think the shape through sculptural codes
	and bring some material qualities to them such as gravity, bending, or
	light. The aim of this approach is to actualize my perception of the shape
	of a letter, and consider the character—not as a legible sign—but as an
	abstract form to find and experiment.
</p>
<p>
	This type design research project takes inspiration from the American
	sculptor Richard Serra’s verb list compilation built between 1967 and 1968,
	published in the journal Avalanche in 1971. It represents 107 words, and it
	consists of a series of “actions to relate to oneself, material, place, and
	process.”
</p>
<p>
	The project is framed by a selection of four verbs of the list—to stretch,
	to pair, of tension, to bounce—and aims to exploit the potential of the
	material and physical properties for the creation of a typeface.

	The documentation of the process is displayed on three posters, each one
	representing a specific work step. The first consists in the manipulation of
	physical objects. The second reports the previous step, but in
	two-dimensional abstract visuals. The last one shows the type characters as
	a logical continuation of the sequence.
</p>
<p>
	Revisiting the work environment and experimenting with tangible objects
	permitted producing expressive shapes, and gave a strong personality to the
	letters.
