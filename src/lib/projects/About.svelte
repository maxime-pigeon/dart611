	In January of 2021, 15 <a

		>Master of Design</a
	> students began gathering on Thursday afternoons on Zoom, clustered on screen,
	but socially distanced in our lounges, offices, kitchens and bedrooms for remote
	class during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It was the end of a long and isolated pandemic
	winter in Montreal where most of the students were based, but many had never
	met each other off-screen. For a student at home in India we noticed it was always
	nighttime in the window behind her, her neighborhood quiet and sleeping. For
	another student, deep in the valleys of France it was also getting late. The
	professor’s dog frequently barked. Sometimes, children, family members or work
	mates wandered past in the background of people’s screens, a window into worlds.
	A companion bird flew about freely in one living room, tweeting comments that
	we assumed were supportive. Over 13 weeks together, we discussed Interdisciplinary
	Practices in Design. We opened each class meeting by sharing our highlights of
	the week: sometimes small moments, sometimes difficult, sometimes pivotal. There
	was much discussion of kombucha, plants, fonts, and the difficulties of accessing
	materials and processes during the pandemic. We shared resources and insights
	from our various design disciplines; spanning architecture, fashion, textiles,
	interior design, graphic design, landscape architecture, publishing, interaction
	design, gaming, and product design.

	This class is a community. The projects that resulted are in dialogue with
	each other, reflecting the designer’s interactions and conversations, and
	the ebb and flow of extending and unravelling ideas across disciplines.
