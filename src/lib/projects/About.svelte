	This class is a practice-based research studio centered on such active
	processes of making and bringing something into being from idea and concept
	to material reality. Through development of the major assignment and all
	other course-related activities, it is hoped that you will develop
	strategies of interdisciplinarity, ontological design and engagement to
	further your own studio work and future praxis.

	This exercise is a first step towards defining an outcome for the final
	project. The Project Proposal differs in significant ways from an artist
	statement or reflective paper, in that it should communicate in lay terms
	the physical and material qualities of the creative work. Focus on the
	format, medium, dimensions, spatial/environmental requirements, technical
	specifications, and any additional information to help visualize the final
	outcome of the production. Of course, it is also important to provide a
	general overview of the theoretical dimensions of the project themes,
	contextual framework, and historical references, as it relates to
	contemporary art and culture. Identify and discuss influences, flex, and
	flux from interdisciplinary thinking and ontological design processes.
	Consider this 750-1000-word text like an exhibition proposal for a gallery
	or a commercial pitch to a client. Use whichever or whatever medium and
	method you would use in your industry to present a new concept. Address the
	preliminary skill sets, materials, resources and facilities that will need
	to be considered throughout the development process.
