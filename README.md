Winter 2021 exhibition website for DART611: Interdisciplinary Practices in Design. See it [here](https://dart611expo.netlify.app).

## Instructions

You need to upload 3 things in [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_h9VrrSlnyya_l3Eez5o_jR_GwNWEhYf) **by April 13**:

1. Column mockup
2. Project description
3. Media folder with your images/videos

### 1. Column Mockup

The website is designed such that each student gets their own "column." Think of it as your own exhibit wall. But keep in mind that you don't control the column's width; it'll change depending on how many projects the user chooses to display.

I need you to show me how you want your column to look like. A simple Google Docs will do. In short, I want to know where you want your images or videos: all at the top, between paragraphs, etc. [Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCufTuchrPEOY7mQda_BspzOxYeGWkdO-jRHo39OA_U/edit).

### 2. Project Description

A separate Google Docs with only the textual description of your work. Please include the project's title. 200â€“500 words. [Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yHUYu0JEjeNIWluX51YPwkM8oTGJsU5-iXbqzVP7vxQ/edit).

### 3. Media folder

A folder with all your images, videos, gifs, etc.

-   Image: JPEG or PNG, approx. 2000px wide
-   Vector: Use SVG files for vector shapes
-   Video: MP4, M4A or WEBM, 1080px
-   GIF: GIF or WEBP, approx 1080px
