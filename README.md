Winter 2021 exhibition website for DART611: Interdisciplinary Practices in Design. See it [here](https://dart611expo.netlify.app).

## Instructions

You need to upload 3 things in [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_h9VrrSlnyya_l3Eez5o_jR_GwNWEhYf) **by April 13**:

1. Mockup of how you want your column to look like
2. Description
3. Folder with your images/videos

### 1. Mockup

The website is designed such that each student gets their own "column". Think of it as your own exhibit wall. But keep in mind that the column's width depends on the number of columns the user chooses to display.

I need you to show me how you want your column to look like. A simple Google Docs will do. In short, I want to know where you want your images/videos: all at the top, between paragraphs, etc. [Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCufTuchrPEOY7mQda_BspzOxYeGWkdO-jRHo39OA_U/edit).

### 2. Description

A separate Google Docs with the textual description of your work. 200â€“500 words. [Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yHUYu0JEjeNIWluX51YPwkM8oTGJsU5-iXbqzVP7vxQ/edit).

### 3. Media folder

A folder with all your images, videos, gifs, etc.

-   Image: JPEG or PNG, approx. 2000px wide
-   Video: MP4, M4A or WEBM, 1080px
-   GIF: GIF or WEBP, approx 1080px
